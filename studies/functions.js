/**
 * FUNCTIONS:
 * 
 * 0: In JavaScript, a function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specialized task.
 * After a function is declared, it can be called, or invoked, at any point to execute its code.
 * Using functions makes it possible to streamline tasks that might otherwise be menial or repetitive.
 * 
 * 1: Declaration vs. Invocation: A function declaration gives a function a name and defines the actions it should execute.
 * Post-declaration, any time we need to use a function, we invoke it.
 * 
 * 2: Parameters vs. Arguments: Parameters are defined in function declarations and act as placeholders for values that will be passed in.
 * Arguments are defined at the time of the function invocation and represent the actual values to be used by the function.
 * 
 * 3: Named Function Syntax: Most functions are declared with names, and this must be done in a specific way.
 * 
 * 4: Functions Assigned to Variables: Functions are allowed to be nameless when assigned to variables.
 * To invoke a function assigned to a variable, we refer to the name of the variable.
 * 
 * 5: Specifying Inputs and Outputs:
 * 
 * 6: Scope:
 * 
 * 7: Closures:
