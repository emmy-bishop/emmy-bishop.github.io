/**
 * LOOPS:
 * 
 * 0: In programming, it is often necessary to repeat some action over and over.
 * An easy way to accomplish this is with the use of a loop.
 * 
 * 1: While, For, and For-In Loops: While loops will execute their code as long as a specified condition is true.
 * In contrast, for loops execute their code as long as a specified condition is false.
 * Finally, for-in loops are used to access and manipulate objects.
 * 
 * 2: Loop Any Number of Times: By changing the way a loop is set up, it is possible to loop any number of times and in either direction (forward or backward).
 * 
 * 3: Loop Over an Array: The for loop is the most common choice when looping over an array.
 * 
 * 4: Loop Over an Object: The for-in loop is the most common choice when looping over an object.
