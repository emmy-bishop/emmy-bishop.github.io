/**
 * LOOPS:
 * 
 * 0: In programming, it is often necessary to repeat some action over and over.
 * An easy way to accomplish this is with the use of a loop.
 * 
 * 1: While, For, and For-In Loops: While loops will execute their code as long as a specified condition is true.
 * In contrast, for loops execute their code as long as a specified condition is false.
 * Finally, for-in loops are used to access and manipulate objects.
 * 
 * 2: Loop Any Number of Times: By changing the way a loop is set up, it is possible to loop any number of times and in either direction (forward or backward).
 * 
 * 3: Loop Over an Array: The for loop is the most common choice when looping over an array.
 * 
 * 4: Loop Over an Object: The for-in loop is the most common choice when looping over an object.

// 1 While, For, and For-In Loops //

// 1. While Loop
// While loops continue to execute the defined code as long as a certain condition remains true
// Typically used when it is unknown how many times a loop will need to repeat
let hour = 6; // establishes hour variable
while (hour < 8) { // loops while hour is less than 8
    console.log(`It is ${hour} and I am a sleepy little guy`); // executes while hour is 6 or 7
    hour++; // increments counter at each iteration
} // prints => It is 6 and I am a sleepy little guy 
  //           It is 7 and I am a sleepy little guy

// 2. For Loop
// For loops continue to execute the defined code as long as a certain condition remains false
// Typically used to iterate over arrays
let seattlePosse = ['Frasier Crane', 'Niles Crane', 'Martin Crane', 'Roz Doyle', 'Daphne Moon'];
