## Tips

* If you completed the prompt in the online sandbox, you'll need to make some modifications to pass the tests here.

* This assignment is not optimized for recursion.

* It's important that you **do not move, or change the name of, any files in these directories**. If you do the tests we have written may not work, and you will have a lot of problems we'll have to solve!

## Remember  
It's important to note the difference between running `.js` files and `.html` files! JavaScript can do a bunch of awesome things, as you will see. Running a `.js` file means you are having each line of JavaScript code in the file run, one by one, from top to bottom. What it will NOT do is create a web page for you. In c9, running a `.js` file results in a new tab that shows everything that is console.logged in that file. 

If you want to see an actual web page, you should run an `.html` file. Anything with the suffix `.html` is going to be HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is like the skeleton of a website, it is the structure, so when you want to see a visualization of something you use HTML. It's possible for HTML to access your JavaScript files and run them inside the website, which we will play with more later in the course.

### Submitting Scratch-Pad

You must submit the project by running `os submit`. Doing so will re-run the tests one last time to make sure you are passing all of them, then send the results to Greenlight if you have passed all tests. 

**You must pass ALL the tests to get a green light.**

If you do not have a green light when you submit, run `os test` to check if you are failing any tests. If you have any questions after that, consult your teacher.
